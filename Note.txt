1. FOR SPACY MODELS

# download best-matching version of specific model for your spaCy installation
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# pip install .whl or .tar.gz archive from path or URL
pip install /Users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gz
pip install /Users/you/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0.tar.gz
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0/en_core_web_sm-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

In general, spaCy expects all model packages to follow the naming convention of [lang]_[name]. For our provided pipelines, we divide the name into three components:

-- type: Model capabilities:

--- core: a general-purpose model with tagging, parsing, lemmatization and named entity recognition

--- dep: only tagging, parsing and lemmatization

--- ent: only named entity recognition

--- sent: only sentence segmentation

-- genre: Type of text the model is trained on (e.g. web for web text, news for news text)

-- size: Model size indicator:

--- sm: no word vectors

--- md: reduced word vector table with 20k unique vectors for ~500k words

--- lg: large word vector table with ~500k entries

For example, en_core_web_md is a medium-sized English model trained on written web text (blogs, news, comments), that includes a tagger, a dependency parser, a lemmatizer, a named entity recognizer and a word vector table with 20k unique vectors.
